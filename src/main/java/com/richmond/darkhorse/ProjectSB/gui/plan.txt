Project{SB}

Benefits:
Parents - Project{SB} allows their child's teacher to send out updates about the child's day and enables daily sheets to be delivered electronically for
personal record/storage rather than becoming another paper to either store or trash 
Teachers - Project{SB} takes all of the tedious and time-consuming tasks teachers complete on a daily basis and puts them on a computer, thereby cutting
the time it takes to complete them and allowing those teachers to spend more time focusing on what really matters--the students 
Directors - Project{SB} makes it so that directors can constantly monitor the ratios of the classrooms within their center, as well as view and sign any
reports. This saves time and conveys necessary but tedious information
