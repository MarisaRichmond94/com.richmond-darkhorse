WHAT IS IT?
ProjectSB is a Java desktop application targeted at early childhood centers. 

MY MISSION: After spending a few months as a preschool teacher working at a strictly paper-based company, I realized just how inefficient it is to run an early 
child-care facility. Between filling out health checks in the morning and writing down what each child did in the afternoon, there isn't much time left to spend with 
the actual children, but other products on the market aimed at solving this problem charge an arm and a leg for the betterment of an education field that does not have
the monetary funds to afford such luxuries. Thus, my mission became to provide an open-source solution for paper-less child-care. The result: ProjectSB

SET-UP
1.) Before the application can be used by directors and teachers at your Early Learning Center, someone must fill out the necessary information (e.g. create the center,
classrooms, as well as director and teacher accounts). In order to do this, the initial user must set up the following information to create the single administrator account:

First Name: John
Last Name: Doe
ID: 000000000

2.) Create your center, filling out the name, license number, location, etc. 
3.) Once you have completed the above two steps, you are free to set up directors, teachers, and classrooms 
4.) When you create director and teacher accounts, these users will be assigned a unique 9-digit ID within the system using the first 4 digits of their associated
center's license number and 5 random numbers. You will need to pass the user their unique 9-digit ID so that they can use their account
