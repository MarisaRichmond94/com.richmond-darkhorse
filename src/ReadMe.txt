ProjectSB
Mission Statement: ProjectSB (short for "Project Special Beginnings) is a java-based program designed 
in order to cut-down on paper waste and better enable teachers to focus their attention on what really matters--the children 

Initial Features:
1.) Allows for one-click generation of daily sheets based on a list of students' attendance plans as well as
student by student addition or removal based on sudden/one-time modifications (e.g. a student is sick, 
a student is adding for a field trip day, etc.) 
2.) Once completed, at 4:30pm each day, daily sheets are automatically stored in students' records as well
as e-mailed to key contacts listed in the students' files (i.e. parents/guardians) 
3.) Enables teachers to electronically fill out behavior reports and incident reports, which will not be
stored in a student's record until they have been sent to the director, signed, and returned. This also eliminates the 
need for the director to go room to room asking for any reports or for teachers to have to leave their room to hand off
last-minute reports to their director
4.) Teachers can take attendance and fill out health checks in less time; additionally, marking a student as present updates 
the ratio for the classroom, so director's can better monitor ratios at the beginning and the end of the day, eliminating the
need to go classroom to classroom and create a sense of chaos while parents are funneling in and out of the center
