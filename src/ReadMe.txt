ProjectSB
Mission Statement: ProjectSB (short for "Project Special Beginnings) is a java-based program designed 
specifically for Special Beginnings Early Childhood Centers in order to cut-down on paper waste and better 
enable teachers to focus their attention on what really matters--the children 

Initial Features:
1.) Allows for one-click generation of daily sheets based on a list of students' attendance plans as well as
student by student addition or removal based on sudden/one-time modifications (e.g. a student is sick, 
a student is adding for a field trip day, etc.) 
2.) Once completed, at 4:30pm each day, daily sheets are automatically stored in students' records as well
as e-mailed to key contacts listed in the students' files (i.e. parents/guardians) 
3.) Enables teachers to electronically fill out behavior reports and incident reports, which will not be
stored in a student's record until they have been sent to the director, signed, and returned for teacher
signature 

Bonus Features: 
1.) Enhances students' records/parent updates by allowing teachers to take photos, which will be added to
daily sheets and stored for future printing (for photo albums); photos will ideally be stored on the cloud
2.) Includes the ability for Directors to more easily schedule employee hours based on availability and then
send a visually simple weekly calendar showing each employee where/when he/she is scheduled to work for the
week, also allowing employees to sign up for holes, as well as for Directors to request an employee to fill
a hole(s)
